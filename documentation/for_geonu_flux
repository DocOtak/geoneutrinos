I've thought of a way for the geonuflux to happen rather quickly.
I would need to use a grid like the data existed in before, then
calculate the nuflux for a point and multiply it by the gird of distances
then shift the grid around till it is in the proper orientation.
then sum the grids and then export the griddata.
